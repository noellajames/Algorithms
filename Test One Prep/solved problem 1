1. The max distance = d
2. The distance between two stopping points is <= d
	(x_j - x_i) <= d
	x_j = end stopping point
	x_i = start point

	R = all the points (x_1, x_2, ... x_n)
	A = all the stopping points chosen

Algorithm

Initially let R be the sorted set of stopping points, and let A be empty. The last point of R is the last point is the end of the trip


Previous stopping point p = 0;
While R is not yet empty
	d <- 0
	Stopping point s = 0;
	While daily distance d is less than or equal to max distance d_max
		Choose the first value i E R and make d = i - p;
		if d > d_max
			add s to A
			p = s;
			break;
		else 
			s = i; 
			remove i from R

	EndWhile
EndWhile
Return the set A as the set of stopping points chosens.
R = {5, 10, 17, 25, 35, 42, 43, 44}


R = {}
max_d = 10
i = 44
d = 9
s = 44
p = 35
A = {10, 17, 25, 35}

Claim: |A| <= |O|

Claim: The distance traveled at the end of any day by A is greater than or equal to the distance traveled by O.
Proof by Induction:

Denote xA_i = the stopping point at the end of day i by the greedy algorithm.
Denote xO_i = the stopping point at the end of day i by the optimal algorithm.
Denote D(x) = the distance from the starting point to a given stop x.

Base Case:
The number of days r = 1. 

At the end of day 1, the algorithm picks up the stopping point xA_1 that has the maximum distance from the stopping point but is less than or equal to d_max. The base case holds true.

D(xA_1) >= D(xO_1) 

Induction Hypothesis:

Now let r > 1. We will assume as our induction hypothesis that the statement is true for r-1, and we will try to prove it for r. Induction hypothesis lets us assume that D(xA_(r-1)) >= D(xO_(r-1)).

Induction Proof:

proof by contradiction:
	Lets assume D(xA_(r)) < D(xO_(r)) is true.
	This suggests that my algorithm stops earlier than the optimal solution.
	D(xA_(r)) - D(xA_(r-1)) < D(xO_(r)) - D(xA_(r-1)) <= max_dist
	This implies that the optimal algorithm stops at a distance further away away from where the greedy algorithm stops. The distance where the optimal algorithm stops is less than the max distance. However, this is a contradiction since the greedy algorithm will consider the addition distance until max_dist.
