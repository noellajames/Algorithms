BFS (G = (V,E))

initialize array mark of size |V| with 0
T = {}
L_o is {s}
mark s with 1
set i to 1
repeat
	Li is all the unmared neighbors of Li-1
	add each edge to tree T
	mark Li
	set i to i-1
until there are no unmaked neighborrs
return T

Find Cycle (G)
T = BFS(G)
Find an edge (u,v) in G that is not in T //there is a cycle
if there is no such edge
	return false; //no cycle
endif
Find the closest ancestor to u and v
