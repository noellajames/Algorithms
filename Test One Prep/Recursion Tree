Claim: T(n) <= cn + cnlog(n) (for all n)

Base Case:
n = 1
When n = 1
T(1) <= c + clog(1) = c. This is true.

Induction Hypothesis: Works for n = k . We will prove that it works for n = k+1.

when n = k
T(k) = ck + cklog(k)

when n = k+1
T(k+1) = 2T((k+1)/2) + c(k+1)
T((k+1)/2) = c((k+1)/2) + c((k+1)/2)log((k+1)/2))
2*(c((k+1)/2) + c((k+1)/2)log((k+1)/2))) + c(k+1)
c(k+1) + c(k+1)log((k+1)/2) + c(k+1)
c(k+1)log((k+1)/2) + 2c(k+1)
(c(k+1)) * (log((k+1)/2) + 2)
(c(k+1)) * (log(k+1) - log(2) + 2)
(c(k+1)) * (log(k+1) + 1)
c(k+1)(log(k+1)) + c(k+1)


T(n) = 2^n - 1 for all n

T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1
T(1) = 1

Base Case:
n = 1
T(1) = 2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1= 1
Thus, the base case is true.

Induction Hypothesis: Works for n = k. We will prove it works for n = k+1

n = k+1
T(k+1) = 2T(k) + 1
T(k+1) = 2(2^k - 1) + 1
T(k+1) = 2^(k+1) - 2 + 1
T(k+1) = 2^(k+1) - 1
This proves true for all values k.

Claim:
sum of first n integers = (n(n+1)) / 2

Base Case
n = 1
1(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1
The base case holds true

Induction hypothesis: Suppose the claim works for n = k. We will prove it works for n = k+1

n = k+1
sum of first k+1 integers:
1 + 2 + ... + k + k+1
= (sum of first k integers) + k+1
= (k(k+1))/2 + k+1
= (k(k+1))/2 + 2*(k+1)/2
= (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
= (k+1)(k+2) / 2
Thus, the induction hypothesis holds true

Use the Principle of Mathematical Induction to verify that, for n any positive integer, 6^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 5 

Base case: 
n = 1
(6^1) - 1 = 5
5 is divisible by 5
Thus, the base case holds true

Induction hypothesis: Suppose the claim works for n = l, We will prove it works for n = k+1

n = k+1
(6^(k+1))-1
= 6^k * 6 - 1
= 6^k * 6 - 6 + 5
= 6(6^k-1 * 1 - 1) + 5
= 6(6^k-1 - 1) + 5
both terms are divisible by 5 so the entire value is divisible by 5
