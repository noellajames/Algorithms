strongly connected (G)

Take a random vertex s from G
run BFS(G,s)
Check to see if all the vertices in G are in T
If there is a vertex(s) missing //not strongly connected
	return false
endif

Construct G-reverse
copy the vertices in G to Grev
For every edge (u,v) in G, 
	insert edge (v,u) in Grev
endfor

run BFS(Grev,s)
Check to see if all the vertices in Grev are in Trev
If there is a vertex(s) missing //not strongly connected
	return false
endif

If it is a strongly connected component, T = Trev
	checks in 5 and 17 cannot be done for a problem that checks strong components
