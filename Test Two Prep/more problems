edge e - c_e f(e)

forward edge exists if f(e) >= 0 and less than c_e
capacity of forward edge is c_e - f(e)
backward edge exists if 0 <f(e)< ce

path from s to u is p1
path from v to t is p2
decrement flow on every edge by one

algorithm to find downward critical edges
iterate through all the edges to identify edges where flow = capacity
Assume e = u,v is such an edge
path from s to u is p1
path from v to t is p2
The path p from s to t is p1 to e to p2
If path p has a cycle, which includes e, the the flow reduction is managed within the cycle
Therefore, e is not a critical edge
If path p is not a cycle, then we need to reduce the flow among the edges in the path
This reduces the maximum flow
Thus, e is a downward critical edge
